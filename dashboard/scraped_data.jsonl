{"text": "There are numerous Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) on DBMS. Here, in this section, we have collected a set of FAQs followed by their brief answers."}
{"text": "A database can be defined as an organized collection of structured data or information. It can be stored either locally or on a remote server."}
{"text": "Components of a DBMS is listed below −"}
{"text": "Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability are known as the ACID properties of DBMS."}
{"text": "Database constraints are some set of rules or conditions that controls behavior of a database table."}
{"text": "A primary key in DBMS is a unique identifier for a record in the specified table. It make sure that each record can be uniquely identified and cannot contain NULL values."}
{"text": "A composite key is a type of primary key that consists of two or more columns together to uniquely identify a record in a table."}
{"text": "A foreign key is a column or set of columns in a table that refers to the primary key of another table, linking the two tables."}
{"text": "A primary key uniquely identifies each record in a table and must not contain null values. A unique key also ensures uniqueness but can allow one null value."}
{"text": "An ER diagram in DBMS is a visual representation of the database schema. Its full form is Entity Relationship Diagram. It shows the entities, their attributes, and the relationships among them."}
{"text": "Entities are real-world objects or concepts depicted in an ER diagram, such as students or courses. Each entity has attributes that describe its characteristics, like a student's name, age, or a course title."}
{"text": "Entities can be classified as strong (independent) or weak (dependent on other entities). Attributes may be simple, composite, or multivalued, each providing different levels of detail about the entity."}
{"text": "Different types of relationships in ER diagrams include:"}
{"text": "Besides these, there are identifying and non-identifying relationships that are based on dependency."}
{"text": "A database view is a virtual table that is created when a query is written using data access language like SQL."}
{"text": "A database trigger is a set of instructions that is automatically executed in response to certain events on a particular table or view."}
{"text": "Listed below are the different database models:"}
{"text": "DBMS is a broad system for managing databases. RDBMS specifically uses tables with predefined relationships."}
{"text": "The three-tier architecture of DBMS is a systematically organized way of managing a database. It separates functionality into three interconnected layers: presentation, application, and database."}
{"text": "Data abstraction in DBMS is a method of hiding complex data storage details from users. It consists of three levels:"}
{"text": "Data refers to raw, unprocessed facts and figures lacking context, such as numbers or individual database entries. Information is data that has been organized, analyzed, and given context, revealing patterns and relationships that provide insights for decision-making."}
{"text": "For example, raw sales numbers are data, whereas a sales report analyzing trends and performance constitutes information."}
{"text": "Cardinality in DBMS depicts the quantitative relationship between two different database entities. It defines the maximum and minimum number of relationships between the associated entities in an ER diagram. Common cardinality types include one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many."}
{"text": "Normalization is a technique for efficient data organization that minimizes redundancy. It involves splitting large tables into smaller, interrelated tables to eliminate data duplication."}
{"text": "Normalization ensures data integrity, reduces update anomalies, and enhances database performance. It is applied in normal forms like 1st Normal Form (1NF), 2nd Normal Form (2NF), and 3rd Normal Form 3NF."}
{"text": "Here's a breakdown of database normal forms with examples −"}
{"text": "BCNF, or Boyce-Codd Normal Form, is a stricter version of 3NF that addresses multiple candidate keys."}
{"text": "A table is in BCNF if, for every dependency A → B, A must be a superkey. This eliminates all redundancy based on functional dependencies."}
{"text": "For instance, with a table containing {StudentID, Course, Professor}, where StudentID and Course together can determine Professor, we would split it into two tables to achieve BCNF: {StudentID, Course} and {Course, Professor}."}
{"text": "Denormalization is the process of combining multiple normalized tables into a single table, often with redundant data. This technique helps to speed up query performance by reducing the need for complex joins, which is especially useful when you need fast data retrieval. Itâs commonly used in data warehouses or reporting systems, where performance is crucial and some level of data redundancy is acceptable."}
{"text": "However, denormalization comes with trade-offs. It can lead to increased storage requirements, and updates become more challenging since the same data might be stored in multiple places. Because of this, careful maintenance is needed to ensure that the data remains consistent and accurate."}
{"text": "SQL commands are categorized into various types:"}
{"text": "These commands help manage database structures, manipulate data, control access, handle transactions, and retrieve data from databases."}
{"text": "Key differences between SQL command types:"}
{"text": "Each command type plays a unique role in database management."}
{"text": "Here's how these commands differ:"}
{"text": "Stored procedures basically represent precompiled SQL code blocks stored in a database. They are super useful when trying to optimize database operations and make them more secure!"}
{"text": "Database indexing is one of the optimization techniques to improve various data retrieval processes. The process enables fast lookup of records in database tables through the creation of supporting data structures."}
{"text": "Its main objective is performance optimization: to minimize the time it takes to execute a query. It applies a balanced tree to reduce disk I/O operations. On the other hand, one should be aware of storage overhead: indexes require additional space."}
{"text": "Clustered indexes define the method of arrangement for physical records. Because of this, there can only be one clustered index per table. Non-clustered indexes, on the other hand, keep all their pointers separately and point to records. There can be more than one non-clustered index per table."}
{"text": "Clustered indexes are highly efficient while offering optimization for sequential accesses, while non clustered variations excel in queries on particular columns, though they require more space."}
{"text": "These are the necessary transaction control actions:"}
{"text": "Together, these mechanisms provide transaction control and ensure database consistency during ongoing processing."}
{"text": "Concurrency control mechanisms ensure controlled access to the database by simultaneous users. This protocol ensures that concurrently executed transactions do not interfere with each other, maintaining a consistent and valid state. The system aims to maximize concurrency while maintaining consistency."}
{"text": "Hashing converts search keys into direct storage addresses using mathematical functions. It enables fast data retrieval via direct addressing."}
{"text": "Static hashing uses fixed bucket allocations, while dynamic hashing adapts to changes in data volume. The choice of an appropriate hash function has a significant impact on performance characteristics."}
{"text": "Query optimization involves the process of selecting rapidly executable plans for database operations."}
{"text": "Implementation techniques are either cost-based or rule-based. Optimization significantly affects query performance by selecting a proper execution plan based on mathematical models and heuristics."}
{"text": "Join types and their purposes include:"}
{"text": "The selection of a join type depends on specific data retrieval requirements. Each join serves different analytical purposes while maintaining referential integrity."}
{"text": "Referential integrity ensures that relationships between tables remain consistent using foreign key constraints. It prevents orphan records, invalid references, and inconsistent relationships."}
{"text": "Maintenance may require cascade operations or restricted modifications. This mechanism is fundamental for preserving database consistency."}
{"text": "Inner joins strictly return matching records between tables, enforcing relationships between them. Outer joins, on the other hand, include non-matching records from one or both tables (LEFT, RIGHT, or FULL), preserving completeness for designated tables."}
